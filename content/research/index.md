      Using a small atmospheric chamber attached to an FTIR spectrometer, I am
      examining how diurnal cycling of temperature and relative humidity affect
      the VNIR spectra of several Mars-relevant hydrous minerals. In particular,
      I am interested in the speed and extent to which these cycles can cause
      phase and hydration state changes, which has implications for the martian
      hydrological cycle.
