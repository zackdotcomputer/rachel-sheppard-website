      Using a small atmospheric chamber attached to an FTIR spectrometer, I am
      examining how diurnal cycling of temperature and relative humidity affect
      the VNIR spectra of several Mars-relevant hydrous minerals. In particular,
      I am interested in the speed and extent to which these cycles can cause
      phase and hydration state changes, which has implications for the martian
      hydrological cycle.

      Using new statistical analyses I am looking at how co-movement of elements
      and geological indicators through time  can inform our understanding of
      water conditions in Lake Gale.

      Using CRISM images processed using a new technique by our coauthors, we
      are revisiting parts of Mt. Sharp other than the rover traverse to
      understand how mineralogy changes across morphological contacts. These
      stratigraphic relationships and how they vary laterally can help constrain
      the crater's history, both during its lacustrine phase and long after.
